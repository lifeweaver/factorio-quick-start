# Quick Start (1.0 Compatible)

Start with one of three item kits to jump start your Factorio experience. The kit can be selected in the mod config settings. 

Small:
A few belts, burner mining drills and plates.

Medium:
Construction Robots, Personal Roboport, Assembling Machines, Electricity, Car

Big:
Lots of Belt, Poles, Assembling Machine 2's, Logistic Chest (Request/Provider), Roboports, Logistic + Construction Robots and other stuff. 
This kit also unlocks all technologies required by the logistics system.

Forked from Pasukaru's mod because the 1.0 update of Factorio broke it.
